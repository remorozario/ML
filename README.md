# Text Classification using Naive Bayes

This program demonstrates text classification using the Naive Bayes algorithm. It uses the `fetch_20newsgroups` dataset from the scikit-learn library, which consists of 20 different newsgroups.

# Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn

# Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

# Usage

1. Run the program using Python:

2. The program will download the fetch_20newsgroups dataset and split it into training and test sets.

3. It will train a Naive Bayes model on the training data and evaluate it on the test data.

4. Finally, it will print the confusion matrix showing the performance of the model on different categories
